### I'm back after a long time, YAY!

#### (Thanks to rapidly evolving AI)

Parenting is never easy, especially if you have twins. I do my 9/5 job and the second shift after. 

What really happened is that I initialized hugo and the repo with the build in my old macbook, and I planned to write content regularly from my other machines as well (because that machine is really old and hot), but life happened and I slowly forgot about my blog. After a long period I had one uninterrupted hour and I decided to check my blog, write something nice, so I installed hugo and had to face with build errors which I was not able to resolve. Unfortunately the time wasn't enough for me to figure out the issue by myself, neither with the help of ChatGPT, hugo forums, black magic, etc.

I left everything as is and invested my very short "free" time to something else.

But tonight I had an idea, what if I just open the project and give a try to fix the issue with **Claude Code** and voila, it was able to fix it within few minutes so I got excited about to give this short update which I think it's amazing since it saved me a lot of time and I'm able to use the engine I wanted to use. 

Big thanks to Anthropic!
