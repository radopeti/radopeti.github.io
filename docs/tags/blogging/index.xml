      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;im-back-after-a-long-time-yay&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m back after a long time, YAY!&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;thanks-to-rapidly-evolving-ai&#34;&gt;(Thanks to rapidly evolving AI)&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Parenting is never easy, especially if you have twins. I do my 9/5 job and the second shift after.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What really happened is that I initialized hugo and the repo with the build in my old macbook, and I planned to write content regularly from my other machines as well (because that machine is really old and hot), but life happened and I slowly forgot about my blog. After a long period I had one uninterrupted hour and I decided to check my blog, write something nice, so I installed hugo and had to face with build errors which I was not able to resolve. Unfortunately the time wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough for me to figure out the issue by myself, neither with the help of ChatGPT, hugo forums, black magic, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
